Well, it started a year and a half ago when you met a man named Minseok at a cafe, but the true beginning was at that party.","\n","^Six months it took. Only six months and you were both besotted with one another, but it was that extra year that created the gap. A year of sporadic messaging and vague talk of him moving closer. The distance bred awkwardness and flakes of doubt. Still you gave him the listing for the house on your street, and when he messaged you that he was going through with it you were overwhelmed with joy. Nerves followed as Minseok moved in and invited you to his house warming/Halloween costume get together that was really the night before the holiday. Suddenly agonizingly aware of your situation and the possibilities.","\n","^Your outfit fit your general unspoken criteria of a costume for these events; a genie. Just enough effort to catch attention, and not so provocative that it warranted any lingering stares; be them judgmental or appraising. The colorful fabric draping on your frame, and your sneakers for comfort. Decorated with bracelets and rings, and earrings that whipped your face if you turned too fast.","\n",{"->":"party"},{"#f":1}],"party":[["^Adrenaline made your hands tremble as your eyes spotted him across the living room. The crowd was a blur, but his figure was crystal. Minseok had a small gathering with the other members that were practically brothers, some friends, and a few friends of friends all inside his newly acquired home. You had determination at your side, but it was meeker than you'd want. He had on a tan jumpsuit with a vacuum at his arm. A hand-cut piece of paper with the printed logo of \"Ghostbusters\" pinned last minute left of center on his chest, seeing as he had been busy with moving house as of late. His hair was shorter, the dye faded to show the natural black, and there was a slight hitch in his shoulder when he picked up a plastic cup to drink, but his smile hadn't dimmed. His gums showing and his small nose scrunching. His laugh carrying over the small crowd and lifting your heart. He was so jovial. Surrounded by friends and oblivious to your existence.","\n","ev","str","^Approach Minseok","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-0","flg":4},"ev","str","^Stay Hidden","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-1","flg":20},{"c-0":["^ ",{"->":"the_next_day"},"\n",{"#f":5}],"c-1":["^ ",{"->":"ending_1"},"\n",{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"ending_1":[["^It wasn't the right time.

Just around the corner from the living room was the staircase, and paired with it was a door. A door to a basement. He hinged it open and flicked on a light. The sickly yellow glow casting threatening shadows on the wood paneled walls. You could hear the echoes of creaks in your ears, and the steps lengthened. The stairwell narrowed, dizzy. Your shoulder leaned into the doorframe. A heartbeat drummed behind you in time with your shallow breaths. A silhouette spun at the bottom. Stretching, squashed. Skulking out of view. A black halo shrunk your vision. Getting smaller and tighter, and your arms couldn't move. Tethered, tied with invisible locks.
